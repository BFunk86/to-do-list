# To-Do List

## Overview:
“To-Do List” is a simple JavaScript app that allows users to maintain a list of tasks. The user should also be able to edit, delete or mark tasks as complete. The development of this app will take place in two phases: Phase I & Phase II. Phase III is optional.

## Requirements:
* The app must be written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* The app will be client-side only and will not connect to any mid-tier or server
* The app does not need to be cross browser compatible
* The app does not need to be responsive
* When the user enters a task in the "To-do" textbox and clicks the ADD button, it will get added to the list
* If they type a task and hit the enter key, it will also get added to the list
* If the user checks the checkbox next to a task, the system will cross-out the task to mark it as completed
* If the user un-checks the checkbox next to a task, the system will remove the cross-out to mark the task as incomplete
* If the user clicks the delete link next to a task, that task will be removed from the list
* If the user clicks the edit link next to a task, the task will become editable
* The user will be able to save their edit by hitting the enter key
* If the user refreshes the page, the task list will be cleared

## Phases:

### Phase I - Without JQuery
* Use the specifications above to build a To-Do List
* You CANNOT use JQuery in phase 1

### Phase II - With JQuery
* Create a separate directory in your projects folder for this version of the assignment
* Modify the JavaScript to take advantage of JQuery

### Phase III - Optional Features
* Animate the strike-through when you check off a task as “done”
* Add a priority (high, med, low) to the tasks
* Clear out the "To-do" field after you add the task and put the cursor back in the box
* Add a "Clear Completed Tasks" button that deletes all checked tasks
* (Optional) Add your own unique feature
